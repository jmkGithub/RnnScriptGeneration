# RnnScriptGeneration

This is the Tv Script generation Project for Udacity, much of my code reused parts of code from earlier lessons. Not included are the model, which is too large for Github and the training data.
There is one bug fix concerning Cuda Tensors in the "Do not alter" Lines as marked in comments, and I altered the path location for training data as training on my personal computer is faster than Udacity's cloud services.
